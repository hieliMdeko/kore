- **Improved EM simulation capabilities**: ADS 2009 Update 1 includes the W2342 Agilent FEM Simulator Element, which provides a fast and accurate finite element method (FEM) solver for 3D electromagnetic (EM) analysis of arbitrary structures. The FEM simulator can handle complex geometries, materials, and boundary conditions, and supports adaptive meshing, frequency sweep, and parameterization. The FEM simulator is integrated with the ADS schematic and layout editors, and can be used with other ADS simulation technologies such as circuit-envelope, harmonic balance, transient, and S-parameter simulation.
- **Enhanced integration with EMPro**: EMPro 2010.07 is a new version of Agilent's 3D EM modeling and simulation platform that is compatible with ADS 2009 Update 1. EMPro 2010.07 allows users to create and import 3D models from various sources, such as CAD files, parameterized objects, or ADS layout components, and simulate them using FEM or finite difference time domain (FDTD) solvers. EMPro 2010.07 also enables users to export S-parameter or field data from EM simulations to ADS for further analysis or optimization.
- **New Connection Manager Server**: The Connection Manager Server is a separate software download that manages connections between hardware and software. The Connection Manager Server allows users to connect multiple instruments or devices to a single PC, and control them from ADS or other software applications. The Connection Manager Server supports various communication protocols, such as GPIB, LAN, USB, or VXI-11, and provides a graphical user interface for configuring and monitoring the connections.

ADS 2009 Update 1 is available for download from the Keysight Knowledge Center[^1^]. Users can also find more information about the installation, licensing, documentation, and support of this update on the same website.
  
In addition to the new features mentioned above, ADS 2009 Update 1 also delivers several enhancements and bug fixes that improve the overall functionality and reliability of ADS. Some of the notable improvements are:

- **Better MMIC and RF Module design flow**: ADS 2009 Update 1 supports a seamless design flow from schematic capture to layout editing to EM simulation to manufacturing. Users can easily create and edit layout components using various tools, such as parameterized cells (PCells), bondwire models, or via models, and verify their performance using integrated EM solvers, such as Momentum or FEM. Users can also export their layout designs to various formats, such as GDSII, ODB++, or DXF, for fabrication or further processing.
- **More accurate and efficient circuit simulation**: ADS 2009 Update 1 offers improved accuracy and speed for various circuit simulation technologies, such as harmonic balance, transient, S-parameter, or circuit-envelope. Users can also take advantage of new features, such as envelope tracking for power amplifier design, envelope impedance analysis for nonlinear stability analysis, or frequency-dependent noise sources for noise figure simulation.
- **Enhanced user interface and usability**: ADS 2009 Update 1 provides a more user-friendly and intuitive interface for various tasks, such as data display, component library management, schematic annotation, or project organization. Users can also customize their preferences and settings for different aspects of ADS, such as fonts, colors, toolbars, or keyboard shortcuts.

With these new features and enhancements, ADS 2009 Update 1 offers a comprehensive and integrated solution for designing and simulating RF, microwave, and high-speed digital systems. ADS 2009 Update 1 is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Solaris operating systems, and requires a valid license to run. Users can contact Keysight support for any questions or issues regarding ADS 2009 Update 1.
