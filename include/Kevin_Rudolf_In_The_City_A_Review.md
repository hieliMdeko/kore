He plays guitar, bass, keyboards and drums on most of the tracks, and also handles the majority of the production.

The album also has some emotional moments, such as the ballad "No Way Out" and the acoustic closer "Scarred".
 
The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Kevin Rudolf's musical skills and catchy hooks, but criticized his lack of originality and identity. Some also felt that the album was too eclectic and inconsistent, and that some of the guest features did not fit well with his style. However, the album was a commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies in the US and earning a gold certification. It also charted in several other countries, such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK.
 
*In The City* is a solid debut album from Kevin Rudolf, who proved that he can make music across different genres and appeal to a wide audience. The album has some flaws, but it also has some memorable songs that showcase his potential as an artist. If you are looking for a pop-rock album with some hip-hop flavor, you might want to check out *In The City*.
  
One of the highlights of the album is the lead single "Let It Rock", which features a guest verse from Lil Wayne and a catchy chorus that samples Kim Carnes' "Bette Davis Eyes". The song is a stadium-ready anthem that showcases Kevin Rudolf's guitar skills and his ability to craft a hook. The song was a huge hit, reaching number two on the Canadian Hot 100, number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, and number three on the Australian ARIA charts. It also received a Grammy nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.
 
Another standout track is "NYC", which features Nas and pays tribute to Kevin Rudolf's hometown of New York City. The song has a nostalgic vibe, with Rudolf singing about his childhood memories and Nas rapping about his love for the city. The song also samples Billy Joel's "New York State of Mind" and features a guitar solo from Rudolf. The song was featured on an episode of CSI: NY and received positive reviews from critics.
 
The album also has some weaker moments, such as "She Can Get It", which features a production collaboration between Rudolf and Chad Hugo of The Neptunes. The song is a generic club track that sounds out of place on the album and does not showcase Rudolf's personality or talent. The song also has some cringe-worthy lyrics, such as "She can get it like she want it / She can get it like she need it / She can get it like she love it / She can get it like she breathe it". The song was criticized by critics and fans alike.
